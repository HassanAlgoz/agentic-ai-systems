### Project: Project-based Learning of Software Engineering

Make lessons with GenAI using this: https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x Essentially I will be able to replicate this site ( https://codecrafters.io/ ).


### Project: Automated Customer Service (Voice).

### Project: The AI Recruiter (HR Tech)

* **Scenario:** HR teams are drowning in PDFs. They need a system to screen candidates instantly.
* **The Build:** An app that takes **Resume PDFs** and a **Job Description**, extracts key data into structured JSON, and outputs a "Fit Score" with reasoning.
* **Key Challenge:** **Reasoning.** The AI must justify *why* a candidate is a good/bad fit (e.g., "Missing Python skill").
* **Primary Tech:** Prompt Engineering, JSON Output Parsers, file processing.

### Project: The Legal Assistant (Arabic RAG)

* **Scenario:** Legal researchers need accurate answers from Ministry of Justice laws without manual searching.
* **The Build:** A chatbot that answers questions based on data scraped from `laws.moj.gov.sa`.
* **Key Challenge:** **Accuracy.** Every answer must cite the specific Article Number. No hallucinations allowed.
* **Primary Tech:** Web Scraping, Vector Databases, Arabic NLP.

### Project: The Data Analyst (Text-to-SQL)

* **Scenario:** Executives want to query their database using natural language, not SQL code.
* **The Build:** An agent that translates questions ("Show me top sales in Riyadh") into SQL queries, executes them, and visualizes the results.
* **Key Challenge:** **Reliability.** The agent must self-correct if the generated SQL is invalid.
* **Primary Tech:** LangChain/LlamaIndex Agents, SQL Toolkits, Data Visualization.

### Project: Create a technical course from scratch, starting from:

- Key skills
- Learning objectives
- Topics
- Sections
- Exercises (with incremental build-up of difficulty without missing pedagogy)
