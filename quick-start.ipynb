            "- Graph-based orchestration: you define a workflow as a graph of tasks/agents with dependencies, so complex multi-step processes can be composed and managed.\n",
            "- Stateful / memory-enabled: agents can maintain state across steps, which is useful for long conversations or multi-turn tasks.\n",
            "- Fault tolerance and retries: designed to handle failures gracefully, with mechanisms to retry or route around errors.\n",
            "- Modularity and reuse: components (agents, tools, memory, policies) can be composed and reused across different workflows.\n",
            "- Suitable for long-running or enterprise-grade automation: ideal for pipelines, complex decision processes, or multi-agent collaboration scenarios.\n",

            "- Building complex AI workflows that require multiple steps and coordination between agents.\n",
