    "### Understanding the Functional API of LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Functional API** allows you to add LangGraph's key features — [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory), [human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts), and [streaming](/oss/python/langgraph/streaming) — to your applications with minimal changes to your existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is designed to integrate these features into existing code that may use standard language primitives for branching and control flow, such as `if` statements, `for` loops, and function calls. Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Functional API uses two key building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`@entrypoint`** – Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\n",
    "* **[`@task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/task)** – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* [Durable execution](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\n",

    "* [Comprehensive memory](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\n",
    "* [Debugging with LangSmith](/langsmith/home): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.\n",

She had appeared one foggy evening a month earlier, slipping through the cracked door of the library as if she owned the place. The townsfolk had watched her with a mixture of curiosity and amusement as she padded between the rows of books, her tail flicking in time with the rustle of pages. She never knocked anything over, never scratched a single tome—she simply settled herself on a high stool near the reference desk and began to read.\\n\\nMira’s eyes were a deep amber, and they seemed to glow whenever she turned a page. She would stare at the words as if they were tiny constellations, tracing their shapes with a paw that hovered just above the paper. The librarians, Mrs. Penelope Hargrove and her grandson, Theo, soon realized that Mira was not just any cat. She could understand the stories she read, and more astonishingly, she could *write* them.\\n\\nOne rainy night, as thunder rattled the panes, a stray kitten named **Pip** slipped into the library, shivering and soaked. Pip was a tiny, mottled gray furball with oversized ears that twitched at every sound. He tried to hide behind a stack of encyclopedias, but Mira’s gentle nudge guided him toward a warm spot on a plush armchair. She lowered her head and brushed her whiskers against his cheek, as if saying, “You’re safe here.”\\n\\nThe next morning, Mrs. Hargrove found a handwritten note tucked between the pages of *The Secret Garden*. It read:\\n\\n> *“The garden is not just a place of flowers, but a sanctuary for those who listen. Come, little one, and hear the stories the wind tells.”*\\n\\nShe looked up to see Mira perched on the arm of the chair, her tail curled around Pip, who was now curled up, eyes half‑closed, listening to the soft rustle of pages. The kitten’s ears perked up whenever a new sentence was spoken aloud, as if the words themselves were a lullaby.\\n\\nFrom that day on, the Midnight Library became a haven for more than just books. Animals of all kinds—squirrels with bright eyes, a shy hedgehog named Quill, even an old barn owl that occasionally swooped in through the open window—found their way to the quiet sanctuary. Each creature was greeted by Mira with a soft purr and a gentle nudge toward a spot where they could curl up and listen.\\n\\nMira’s true talent, however, was not just in reading or comforting. She could *weave* stories from the thoughts and feelings that swirled in the hearts of those who entered. When a child cried over a lost toy, Mira would curl up beside them and, with a flick of her tail, conjure a tale of a brave mouse who embarked on a daring rescue mission. When an elderly man sighed with nostalgia, she would settle on his lap and spin a yarn about a distant sea voyage that seemed to echo his own memories.\\n\\nOne evening, as the town prepared for its annual Harvest Festival, a sudden storm rolled in, threatening to cancel the celebrations. The townsfolk gathered in the library, worried that the rain would wash away their plans. Mira leapt onto the central reading table, her paws landing softly on a stack of old maps. She stared at the ceiling, then at the anxious faces around her, and began to purr—a deep, resonant sound that seemed to vibrate through the very walls.\\n\\nAs the purring grew louder, the lights flickered, and a soft glow began to emanate from the books themselves. The pages fluttered, and words rose off the paper like fireflies, forming a luminous tapestry across the ceiling. The story that unfolded was one of a brave cat who, during a storm, guided a lost flock of birds back to safety by leading them through a hidden tunnel beneath the town. The tale ended with a promise: *“When the rain falls, the heart of the library shines brighter than any lantern.”*\\n\\nThe next morning, the storm had passed, and the sky cleared to a brilliant sunrise.

       "\n",
       "### 1.1. Background and Motivation  \n",
       "\n",
       "The performance of large language models (LLMs) exhibits a remarkably predictable dependence on three principal scaling factors: model size (parameter count), dataset size, and compute budget (often measured in FLOPs). Empirical studies—most notably the “scaling laws” first formalized by Kaplan *et al.* (2020) and subsequently refined by a growing body of work—have demonstrated that, within certain regimes, the error of a model scales as a power‑law function of these variables. This regularity has profound implications:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Predictive Power:** It enables researchers and practitioners to forecast the resources required to achieve a target level of performance, guiding efficient allocation of compute and data.  \n",
       "* **Design Guidance:** Scaling laws inform architectural decisions (e.g., depth vs. width, token‑mix strategies) and help prioritize research directions such as sparsity, mixture‑of‑experts, or curriculum learning.  \n",
       "* **Economic & Ethical Considerations:** Understanding the cost‑performance trade‑offs is essential for responsible deployment, budgeting, and assessing the environmental footprint of ever‑larger models.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Despite their utility, existing scaling‑law analyses are often limited to specific model families, training regimes, or evaluation metrics. Moreover, the rapid emergence of new model architectures (e.g., transformer‑based diffusion language models, retrieval‑augmented generators) and training paradigms (e.g., multi‑task fine‑tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback) raises questions about the generality and robustness of traditional scaling relationships.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1.2. Objectives  \n",
       "\n",
       "The primary objective of this report is to **systematically investigate the scaling behavior of contemporary LLMs across a broad spectrum of model sizes, data regimes, and compute budgets**. Specifically, we aim to:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Quantify Scaling Relationships** – Derive empirical power‑law exponents for loss, downstream task performance, and inference latency as functions of parameter count, training token count, and FLOPs, respectively.  \n",
       "2. **Assess Regime Boundaries** – Identify the transition points between the *pre‑training*, *scaling*, and *post‑training* regimes, and examine how factors such as token‑type distribution, optimizer choice, and regularization affect these boundaries.  \n",
       "3. **Evaluate Generalization Across Architectures** – Test whether the identified scaling laws hold for diverse model families (e.g., dense transformers, sparsely‑gated mixture‑of‑experts, retrieval‑augmented models) and for a variety of downstream tasks (language modeling, reasoning, code generation, multilingual benchmarks).  \n",
       "4. **Provide Practical Recommendations** – Translate the findings into actionable guidance for model selection, data collection, and compute budgeting under fixed performance targets.  \n",

       "\n",
       "Large language models (LLMs) are a class of neural‑network‑based systems that have dramatically reshaped natural‑language processing (NLP) and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade. Their evolution can be traced through three interrelated milestones:\n",

       "| Milestone | Year | Model / Architecture | Key Advances |\n",
       "|-----------|------|----------------------|--------------|\n",
       "| **Early Distributed Representations** | 2013‑2015 | Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText | Introduced dense, context‑aware embeddings that made vector‑space semantics tractable for downstream tasks. |\n",
       "| **Transformer Paradigm** | 2017 | *Attention Is All You Need* (Vaswani et al.) | Replaced recurrent and convolutional layers with self‑attention, enabling parallel computation and scalable context handling. |\n",
       "| **Pre‑training at Scale** | 2018‑2020 | OpenAI GPT‑1/2, Google BERT, Microsoft Turing‑NLG | Demonstrated that massive unsupervised pre‑training on heterogeneous text corpora yields emergent linguistic abilities that transfer to a wide range of downstream tasks. |\n",
       "| **Massive Parameter Regimes** | 2020‑2023 | GPT‑3 (175 B), Megatron‑Turing‑NLG (530 B), PaLM‑2 (up to 540 B) | Showed that increasing model size—both in parameters and training compute—produces systematic gains in few‑shot learning, reasoning, and multilingual competence. |\n",
       "| **Multimodal & Structured Integration** | 2023‑present | GPT‑4‑V, LLaMA‑2‑Chat, Gemini, Claude‑3 | Extends LLMs beyond pure text to incorporate images, code, tables, and structured knowledge, while refining alignment and safety mechanisms. |\n",
       "\n",
       "The trajectory is characterized not merely by a quantitative increase in parameter count, but by a qualitative shift in *capability*: from models that excel at narrow, supervised tasks to systems that exhibit emergent properties such as chain‑of‑thought reasoning, code synthesis, and cross‑modal understanding. This shift has been enabled by three synergistic developments:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Data‑centric scaling** – curated, high‑quality corpora (e.g., The Pile, Common Crawl, filtered Wikipedia) that provide richer linguistic diversity.  \n",
       "2. **Compute‑efficient training** – techniques such as mixed‑precision arithmetic, gradient checkpointing, and optimizer variants (e.g., AdamW) that make training billions of parameters feasible on commodity hardware clusters.  \n",
       "3. **Architectural refinements** – layer‑norm variants, rotary positional embeddings, and sparsity‑aware attention mechanisms that improve stability and reduce memory footprints.\n",
       "\n",
       "Collectively, these advances have positioned LLMs as the foundational substrate for a new generation of AI‑driven applications, ranging from conversational agents and content generation to scientific discovery and automated reasoning.\n",

       "### 2.2. Definition of Scaling Laws  \n",
       "\n",
       "Scaling laws are empirical relationships that describe how the performance of a neural‑network model—typically measured by a downstream benchmark metric—improves as a function of three controllable resources:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Model size** – usually expressed in terms of the number of parameters, \\(N\\).  \n",
       "2. **Training compute** – the total amount of floating‑point operations (FLOPs) expended during training, \\(C\\).  \n",
       "3. **Dataset size** – the number of training tokens or examples, \\(D\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "In their simplest form, scaling laws can be written as:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\mathcal{L}(N, C, D) \\approx A \\, N^{-\\alpha} \\, C^{-\\beta} \\, D^{-\\gamma},\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "where \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) denotes the loss (or error) on a held‑out validation set, and \\(A, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\) are positive constants estimated from experimental data. More commonly, researchers express *error* (e.g., perplexity) as a power‑law function of the *effective* compute per parameter:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Error} \\propto \\left(\\frac{C}{N}\\right)^{-\\xi},\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "with \\(\\xi\\) representing the *scaling exponent* that captures the diminishing returns of adding more compute.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key properties of these laws include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Power‑law behavior**: Performance improves smoothly and predictably as a function of scale, rather than exhibiting abrupt phase transitions.  \n",
       "- **Optimal allocation**: Given a fixed budget \\(B = C \\times N\\), the error is minimized when compute and model size are balanced according to the exponents \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\).  \n",
       "- **Generalization to new tasks**: Scaling laws observed on language‑model pre‑training loss often transfer to downstream few‑shot performance, suggesting that the same underlying resource–error relationship governs both pre‑training and fine‑tuning regimes.\n",
       "\n",
       "These empirical regularities have become a guiding principle for research planning, allowing practitioners to forecast the trade‑offs between model size, data collection, and compute allocation before committing to expensive training runs.\n",

       "| **1970s–1980s** | Statistical Physics | Distribution of energy states in Ising models | Introduced the concept of scale‑free behavior, later adapted to characterize parameter distributions in neural networks. |\n",
       "| **1990s** | Connectionist Learning | Scaling of required training examples with network depth | Early work on *capacity* showed that the number of trainable parameters must grow polynomially with task complexity. |\n",
       "| **2000s** | Speech Recognition | Relationship between acoustic model size and word error rate | Demonstrated that larger acoustic models reduced error roughly as a power of model size, foreshadowing later LLM scaling. |\n",
       "| **2010s** | Image Classification | Accuracy vs. number of layers / filters | Empirical studies (e.g., Krizhevsky et al., 2012) revealed diminishing error improvements with additional layers, prompting the adoption of residual connections and deeper architectures. |\n",
       "| **2020s** | Large Language Models | Loss vs. parameters, tokens, and FLOPs | Systematic studies (e.g., Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022) quantified scaling exponents, establishing that *model performance follows a predictable power‑law* with respect to each resource dimension. |\n",
       "\n",
       "The **historical thread** linking these observations is the recurring pattern that *error or error‑relevant metrics decrease as a power of the underlying resource*. In early AI, this manifested as a need for exponentially more training data to achieve linear gains in accuracy. With the advent of deep, over‑parameterized networks, the relationship softened to a *polynomial* (often square‑root) scaling, enabling more efficient utilization of compute.\n",
       "\n",
       "The modern **scaling law literature** formalizes this intuition:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Kaplan et al. (2020)** introduced a simple power‑law model linking loss to model size, dataset size, and compute, showing that *optimal performance* is achieved when \\(N \\propto C^{1/2}\\) and \\(D \\propto N\\).  \n",
       "- **Hoffmann et al. (2022)** extended the analysis to the *Chinchilla* regime, proving that *beyond a certain point, allocating more compute to data yields greater returns than enlarging the model*.  \n",
       "- **Chinchilla & PaLM‑2 studies** empirically validated that *training a 70 B‑parameter model on 1.4 × the data used for a 175 B model yields comparable downstream performance*, underscoring the practical relevance of scaling‑law‑guided resource allocation.\n",
       "\n",
       "These historical insights collectively illustrate a **unifying principle**: *the performance of AI systems obeys power‑law scaling with respect to the fundamental resources of model capacity, data, and compute*. Recognizing and leveraging this principle has become a cornerstone of contemporary AI research, informing everything from architecture design to budgeting of large‑scale training campaigns.  \n",

The renormalization‑group (RG) framework explains that such dependencies are universal, arising from the fixed‑point structure of the RG flow.  By mapping the resource variable \\(R\\) onto a temperature‑like control parameter and the performance variable \\(P\\) onto an order parameter, the exponent \\(\\alpha\\) can be identified with a critical exponent associated with a relevant RG eigenvalue.  This viewpoint justifies the robustness of power‑law scaling across disparate domains: the same universality class yields the same \\(\\alpha\\) irrespective of microscopic details.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Information‑Theoretic Perspective** – From the standpoint of **Shannon entropy**, the distribution of resource allocations that maximizes entropy under constraints of fixed mean and variance is a power‑law (Pareto) distribution.  When performance is interpreted as a function of the entropy of the underlying stochastic process, the scaling exponent \\(\\alpha\\) can be linked to the exponent governing the tail of this entropy distribution.  Moreover, the **Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy** of a dynamical system quantifies the rate of information production; in systems where information production scales sub‑linearly with resource consumption, the exponent \\(\\alpha\\) emerges as the ratio of information‑production rate to resource‑consumption rate.  Thus, \\(\\alpha\\) can be interpreted as a measure of *efficiency of information processing* in the system.\n",

       "* **Empirical deviations.** In several experimental regimes the observed scaling deviates systematically from the theoretically predicted power‑law exponent. Specifically, for input distributions with heavy tails, the exponent appears to saturate at a lower value than anticipated, suggesting the presence of hidden bottlenecks that are not captured by the baseline model.  \n",
       "* **Finite‑size effects.** The power‑law regime is only observable over a limited range of scales; beyond this range, discretization and boundary effects dominate, leading to curvature in log‑log plots. Quantifying the size of the “asymptotic window” remains an open analytical challenge.  \n",
       "* **Model dependence.** The deviations are sensitive to the choice of regularization and initialization strategies. While certain initialization schemes restore power‑law behavior, they introduce additional hyper‑parameters whose optimal settings are not yet fully understood.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**Open question:** *Can a unified theoretical framework be developed that predicts the conditions under which power‑law scaling breaks down, and that provides principled remedies (e.g., adaptive regularization) to recover the ideal exponent?*  \n",

       "* **Out‑of‑distribution (OOD) inputs.** The current experiments focus on a narrow band of input statistics (e.g., Gaussian, low‑frequency sinusoids). Preliminary tests on OOD datasets reveal a marked degradation in performance, indicating that the learned representations may be over‑fitted to the training distribution.  \n",
       "* **Temporal and dynamical extensions.** Although the static analysis suffices for the present scope, extending the methodology to time‑varying or sequential inputs raises questions about stability, memory retention, and the emergence of recurrent dynamics.  \n",

In some cases, sparsity leads to a flattening of the power‑law tail, whereas in others it accentuates it.  \n",

Systematic ablation studies are required to isolate which components are responsible for observed deviations.  \n",

Quantifying the environmental footprint of such training pipelines and exploring energy‑efficient alternatives is an emerging priority.  \n",
       "* **Bias amplification.** The statistical regularities captured by power‑law models can inadvertently reinforce existing societal biases present in the training data. For instance, skewed frequency distributions may cause over‑representation of certain subpopulations, leading to disparate impacts in downstream applications.  \n",
       "* **Transparency and accountability.** The opaque nature of scaling relationships can hinder interpretability, making it difficult to audit model behavior or to certify compliance with fairness and safety standards. Developing explainable metrics that link scaling exponents to ethical outcomes is an open research avenue.  \n",

       "   - *Implications*: Scaling laws must now account for *cross‑modal token budgets* and *alignment costs* (e.g., joint embedding layers, contrastive pre‑training). Early evidence suggests that *effective* model size grows sub‑linearly with raw parameter count when modalities are balanced, prompting a re‑examination of “bigger‑is‑better” heuristics.  \n",

       "   - *Implications*: Scaling regimes shift from “parameter‑heavy” to “compute‑heavy” regimes, where *effective* model size is measured in *reasoning steps per token* and *depth of latent deliberation*. This gives rise to *sparse* scaling laws that penalize unnecessary breadth but reward depth.  \n",

       "   - Traditional scaling laws relate model performance \\(P\\) to parameter count \\(N\\) and dataset size \\(D\\) as \\(P \\propto N^{\\alpha} D^{\\beta}\\). Recent work proposes *data‑efficiency* indices that weight each token by its *informational gain* (e.g., novelty, difficulty, semantic richness).  \n",

       "3. **Predictive Modelling and Generalisation Bounds**  \n",
       "   - Leveraging statistical learning theory, researchers are deriving *generalisation bounds* that tie scaling exponents to *covering numbers* of the data manifold.

       "   - *Workflow*: Users specify a utility function (e.g., cost‑weighted accuracy), and the system iteratively samples scaling configurations, evaluates them on proxy tasks, and refines its policy via reinforcement learning.\n",

If the evaluator or a [human-in-the-loop](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) determines the response needs refinement, feedback is provided and the response is recreated. This loop continues until an acceptable response is generated.\n",
