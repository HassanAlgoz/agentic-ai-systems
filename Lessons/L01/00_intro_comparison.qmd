title: "Introduction: What is Agentic AI?"
format: html
---

**Artificial Intelligence** is a field of Computer Science, studying how to automate decision making.

**Agentic AI** is where autonomy of the system is at the level of dealing not just with structured tabular data, but with unstructured data such as natural language, speech, visual to inform their decision, in a growingly less supervised manner; and hence, autonomous.

Specifically, today's Agentic AI systems are driven by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## Case Studies

**Homework**: read 3 [Case Studies](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/case-studies) and make a presentation about one.

## Agent Framework

In programming, frameworks are a way of thinking about a logical system. In two-folds:

Firslty, [**Abstractions**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy): which are the conceptual objects that are defined with specific properties and rules of interaction with other objects. Langchain has:

- Agents
- Models
- Messages
- Tools
- Short-term memory
- Streaming
- Structured output

Secondly, [**Integrations**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview): which are "external" objects that interact with our internal framework of objects. Langchain has:

- Chat models
- Tools and toolkits
- Middleware
- Retrievers
- Text splitters
- Embedding models
- Vector stores
- Document loaders
- Key-value stores

Examples of Agentic frameworks are:

- [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview)
- Vercel’s AI SDK
- CrewAI
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- Google ADK
- LlamaIndex

## Agent Runtime

Runtimes manage state, and state transitions (orchestration). In other words, building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. Concretely, things like:

* **Control-flow**: Step by step instructions, conditional execution, and loops.
* **Persistence**: Thread-level and cross-thread persistence for state management.
* **Durable execution**: Agents persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
* **Streaming**: Support for streaming workflows and responses.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state.

Examples:

- [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)
- Temporal
- Inngest

Note: for the best DX (Developer Experience), we will be using the **Functional API**.

## Agent Platform

**LangSmith**:

* **Deployment**: `localhost` -> production server
* **Observability**: tracing, real-time monitoring, alerting and usage.
* **Evaluation**: testing versions and providing feedback on traces.

## Key Takeways

- LangChain is the framework.
- LangGraph is the runtime.
- LangSmith is the platform.
