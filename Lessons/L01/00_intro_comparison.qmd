## Agent Framework

Frameworks standardize how a team builds via:

- [**Abstractions**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/philosophy):
    - Agents
    - Models
    - Messages
    - Tools
    - Short-term memory
    - Streaming
    - Structured output
- [**Integrations**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview)
  - Chat models
  - Tools and toolkits
  - Middleware
  - Retrievers
  - Text splitters
  - Embedding models
  - Vector stores
  - Document loaders
  - Key-value stores

Examples:

- [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview)
- Vercel’s AI SDK
- CrewAI
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- Google ADK
- LlamaIndex

## Agent Runtime

Orchestration frameworks and runtimes for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. Concretely:

* **Persistence**: Thread-level and cross-thread persistence for state management.
* **Durable execution**: Agents persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
* **Streaming**: Support for streaming workflows and responses.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state.

Examples:

- [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)
- Temporal
- Inngest

Note: for the best DX, use the **Functional API**.
